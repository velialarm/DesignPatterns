The Chain of Responsibility is known as a behavioural pattern, as it's used to manage algorithms, relationships and responsibilities between objects. 

Chain of Responsibility allows a number of classes to attempt to handle a request, independently of any other object along the chain. Once the request is handled, it completes it's journey through the chain.

Would I Use This Pattern?

Multiple objects can handle a request and the handler doesn't have to be a specific object
A set of objects should be able to handle a request with the handler determined at runtime
A request not being handled is an acceptable outcome.
